# Swiphr Product Add Page

Design Repo : https://www.figma.com/file/HHRtuKbgtz3BDCS5gIUzNf/swiphr-ui-test?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=0RAAyiK2DgN4zIUN-0

** The page you are looking for is http://localhost:3000/product/add **

## Solution: Why I choose to use nextjs and tailwind
  Although the ui would have been easier built with html css and vanilla javascript. The reason I did this is because I assume a page like this would need to be integrated with an mvp that is going to be a production grade web application; hence I chose a production grade framework(next) and standrdized css framework (tailwind) which although more work initially will scale better and faster when working with teams and expanding the project

## Workflow
1. Write html and css (tailwind) for all components
1. Add Js for dropdown functionality
1. Add Js for Navbar responsiveness? with react-responsive? - Did not add since design did not specify implementation of the mobile sidebar
1. Layout components on the page
